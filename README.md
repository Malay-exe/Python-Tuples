# Python Tuples

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and examples for working with **tuples** in Python. Tuples are immutable, ordered collections of elements, often used to group related data. This repository is ideal for Python developers who want to understand tuples and their practical applications.

---

## Features
- **Basics of Tuples**: Creation, indexing, and slicing.
- **Tuple Operations**: Concatenation, repetition, and membership testing.
- **Unpacking Tuples**: Assigning tuple elements to variables.
- **Built-in Functions**: Using `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, and more with tuples.
- **Nested Tuples**: Working with tuples within tuples.
- **Immutable Nature**: Demonstrating the immutability of tuples.
- **Performance**: Comparing tuples with lists in terms of performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Malay-exe/python-tuples.git
   cd python-tuples
    ```
## Why Tuples?

- **Immutable**: Ensures data integrity.
- **Performance**: Faster than lists for fixed-size data.
- **Hashable**: Can be used as keys in dictionaries.
